# -SQL-POWER-BI-DATA-ANALYSIS-PORTFOLIO-PROJECT
This project entails both SQL and Power BI components utilizing the AdventureWorksDW2002.bak file. Initially, SQL statements were employed to extract relevant data into CSV files, facilitating integration with Power BI to construct a comprehensive dashboard. The dashboard comprises two distinct pages:

Sales Report: This page presents a detailed sales analysis across various dimensions including product name, product category, and customer city. It utilizes diverse graphical representations to effectively illustrate the correlations between these variables.

Customer Report: Emphasizing the top five customers, geographical sales distribution, and insights into income levels and number of children per customer, this page provides a comprehensive overview of customer demographics and purchasing behaviors.
